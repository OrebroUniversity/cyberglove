The aass_cyberglove node connects to a 18-sensor cyberglove by default. If a cyberglove with 22
sensors is used, the define statement #define ACTUAL_GLOVE_SIZE 18 in line 41 of the file
/include/cyberglove/serial_glove.h needs to be commented out prior to compilation.

Run the node with roslaunch aass_cyberglove aass_cyberglove.launch
